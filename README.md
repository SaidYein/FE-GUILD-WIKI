## Architecture and Main Libraries
#### Description
In this section, provide an overview of the application's architecture, detailing the technologies, frameworks, and primary libraries utilized. Ensure that each library includes a link to its official documentation and a brief explanation of its purpose. Explain  This will help developers grasp the structure, components, and essential tools within the application.
```markdown
# Example
The XYZ Front-End Application is built using the following technologies and libraries:

**Technologies**
1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. Redux: A state management tool.
...
The application follows a component-based architecture, where each component is responsible for a specific part of the user interface.

**Main Libraries**
1. React: The main library for building user interfaces. [React Documentation]()
2. Redux: For state management across the application. [Redux Documentation]()
...
**Specific Libraries**
1. Axios: For making HTTP requests. [Axios Documentation]() 
2. Formik: For handling form state and validation. [Formik Documentation]()
...
```
## Development Setup and Deployment
#### Description
In this section, provide detailed instructions for setting up the development environment and deploying the application. Include the necessary configurations, tools, and steps to ensure a consistent and error-free setup for all developers. Additionally, provide deployment instructions for different environments, such as staging and production, to facilitate a smooth and reliable process.

Cover all necessary prerequisites, such as software versions, environment variables, and dependencies, to help new developers quickly get up to speed. For deployment, give step-by-step instructions from building the application to uploading it to the server or cloud provider. Highlight any potential issues and their solutions.

Include any additional tools or services required for development or deployment, such as version control, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring tools. This ensures a comprehensive understanding of the technology stack and facilitates effective contributions to the project.
```markdown
# Example
To set up the development environment and deploy the XYZ Front-End Application:

1. Install Node.js and npm from the official website.
2. Use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your code editor.
3. Create a .env file in the root directory with the API URL: REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com.
4. Build the application using npm run build.
5. Upload the build directory to your web server or cloud provider (e.g., AWS S3, Netlify).
```

## Component Documentation 
#### Description
In this subsection, provide a brief overview of the complex components. Complex components can be hard or time consuming to understand and to worrk on. Explain how they are structured, what is the purpose and provide step-by-step implementation details to guide developers on how to create or understand the component.
```markdown
# Example
**About the component**
The Authorization Modal is a reusable component that provides user authentication functionality, including login and registration forms. It uses React for the UI, Redux for state management, and Axios for API calls...

**Steps of implementation**
1. Component Structure
  - Describe the directory and file structure for the component.
2. Key Points in the Code
  - Import necessary libraries such as React and Redux hooks.
  - Use useState to manage form data and modal state (login or register).
  - Implement form handlers for onChange and onSubmit events.
  - Dispatch authentication actions (loginUser or registerUser) based on the form state.
  - Implement the modal's JSX structure with conditional rendering for login and register forms.
  - Highlight key aspects or logic of the component without delving into the actual code.
3. Styling
  - Style the modal to ensure it is centered and responsive.
  - Add styles for form inputs, buttons, and other elements.
  - Ensure the modal has a background overlay to distinguish it from the main content.
```    
By following these guidelines, you can implement a functional and styled Authorization Modal component that handles user authentication efficiently. This approach ensures that the component is maintainable, reusable, and aligns with the application's overall architecture.

## Project Background and Resources
#### Description
In this section, provide a brief overview of the project, including the primary objectives, target audience, and any key stakeholders. The goal is to provide new team members with context about the project's purpose and its broader implications. Additionally, include links to all relevant external resources, such as API documentation and third-party integrations, as well as key architecture decisions that shape the frontend of the project.
#### Project Overview
Start with a brief overview of the project. This should include the primary objectives, target audience, and any key stakeholders:
```markdown
# Example
"The XYZ Project aims to revolutionize the customer experience on our e-commerce platform by integrating advanced search functionalities and personalized recommendations. Targeted primarily at young adults aged 18-35, the project seeks to enhance user engagement and boost sales conversions."
```
#### External Resources and API Documentation
Provide links to all relevant external resources that new team members might need. This includes API documentation, third-party integrations, and any other critical references that support the frontend development process.
```markdown
# Example
"For detailed API interactions, please refer to our API Documentation. Additionally, you can find useful information on the third-party services we are integrating with at the following links:
Service A Documentation
Service B Documentation"
```
#### Frontend Architecture Decisions
Detail the key architecture decisions that shape the frontend of the project. This includes the framework used, state management strategies, component structure, and any design patterns or principles adhered to. The aim is to explain the rationale behind these choices to ensure consistency and understanding across the team.
```markdown
# Example
"The frontend architecture of the XYZ Project is built using React for its component-based structure and reusability. We are using Redux for state management to maintain a predictable state container. Our component structure follows the Atomic Design principles, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Key design patterns like the Container-Presenter pattern are employed to separate concerns and enhance testability."
```
## Version Updates and Development Guidelines
#### Description
Documenting version updates and complex deployment steps is crucial for maintaining consistency and ensuring smooth upgrades. This section focuses on documenting version update procedures, deployment steps, and development guidelines to maintain consistency and facilitate seamless collaboration.

**Changelog:** If there is a changelog, we need to add a link to it or a path where it can be found. If there is no changelog, we need to describe at a general level the main changes in the versions. and that it makes sense to describe not patch versions, but if the application has several major versions.

**Step-by-Step:** Provide detailed steps for complex deployments.
```markdown
# Example
"When updating to version 1.2.0, follow these steps:
1- Backup: Ensure that you have a backup of the current state.
2- Update Dependencies: Run npm install to update to the latest dependencies.
3- Migrate Code: Refer to the migration guide in the docs/migration.md file for necessary code changes.
4- Test: Run all unit and integration tests to ensure nothing is broken."
```
**Guidelines:** List general and specific development practices.
```markdown
# Example
List general and specific development practices to ensure consistency across the team.
1- Code Style: Follow the ESLint rules specified in .eslintrc.
2- Commits: Use conventional commits for clear and structured commit messages.
3- Testing: Write unit tests for all new components and functionalities.
4- Reviews: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other team member.
```
