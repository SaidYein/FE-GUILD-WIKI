# WELCOME TO FRONTEND WIKI
## Project Structure and Component Documentation

### Folder Structure

Here's an overview of the project's main folder structure:
the user interface, handling user interactions, and communicating with backend services. The frontend code is built using modern web technologies and frameworks to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.

Technologies
Primary Framework:

React: We use React, a popular JavaScript library, to build reusable UI components and manage the application state efficiently.
State Management:

Redux: For handling complex state across the application, we employ Redux, which provides a coherent structure for managing state.
Routing:

React Router: This library is used to manage navigation and routing within the application, ensuring a seamless user experience when moving between different views.
HTTP Requests:

Axios: We use Axios for making HTTP requests to our backend services. It simplifies the process of sending asynchronous requests and handling responses.
Form Handling:

Formik: To manage and validate form state, we use Formik, which helps in creating complex forms with ease.
